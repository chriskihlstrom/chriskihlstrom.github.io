I decided to learn about coding a few years ago.  I have been working in the apparel industry for many years and the job market has begun to dry up.  It used to be an industry that always had jobs for graphic artists in New York City.  It has now become very hard to find full time work in that line of work.
 
In 2015 I read an article in the Wall Street Journal about the Flatiron School that really got my attention.  It talked about the high rate of success of the students and the strong demand for coding in the tech industry.  I wanted to learn more about the school and about coding.

I started reading books about coding and taking Online classes in UX design and coding.  UX seemed to be a good way to go.  However, even though there is a lot of demand there is also a lot of competition.  Coding seemed to be a better way to break in to the tech industry.  That was my thought process in enrolling in the Flatiron School.
